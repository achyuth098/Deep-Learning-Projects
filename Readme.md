## üîç Description

This repository contains four distinct deep-learning projects:

1. **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN)**  
   - Predict customer churn from tabular banking data  
   - Data loading, one-hot encoding, scaling, regularization, dropout & early stopping  
2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
   - Image classification with Keras & `ImageDataGenerator`  
   - Stacked Conv2D ‚Üí BatchNorm ‚Üí MaxPool ‚Üí Dense layers  
3. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**  
   - Sequence modeling with LSTM layers  
   - Demonstrates bidirectional LSTM on time-series or text data  
4. **NLP Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Compare rule-based TextBlob vs. social-media-tuned VADER on restaurant reviews  
   - Preprocessing (tokenize, lemmatize), classification report & confusion matrices
